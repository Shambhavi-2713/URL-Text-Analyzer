This project involves extracting textual data from specified URLs and conducting comprehensive text analysis. Using Python, it fetches HTML content, parses articles using BeautifulSoup, and saves them into text files. Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) is employed for tasks like tokenization, sentiment analysis, and readability metrics calculation. The output is structured into an Excel file with computed variables such as sentiment scores, readability indices, and word metrics for each article. Dependencies include Python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, nltk, pandas, and openpyxl, ensuring accurate data extraction and analysis.
